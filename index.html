				<h2>Information about the Isle of Man TT Races:</h2>
				 <p>The Isle of Man is known around the globe as an undisputed world-class destination for motorsport.
					Thousands of visitors from across the globe visit the Isle of Man each year for the
					greatest road racing event in the world - the TT Races. The 37 and <small>3/4</small> mile
					Mountain Course that sees racers from around the world reach average lap speeds of
					up to 133mph.</p>

				 <p>The International Isle of Man TT (Tourist Trophy) Race is an annual motorcycle sport event run
					on the Isle of Man in May or June every years since its inaugural race in 1907. The event consists
					of one week of practice sessions followed by one week of racing. It has been a tradition perhaps started by racing competitors in the early 1920s for spectators to tour the Snaefell
					Mountain Course on motorcycles during the Isle of Man TT on "Mad Sunday", an
					informal and unofficial sanctioned event held on the Sunday between 'Practice Week'
					and 'Race Week.'</p>

				 <p>The first Isle of Man TT race was held on Tuesday 28 May 1907 and was called the International
					Auto-Cycle Tourist Trophy. The event was organised by the Auto-Cycle Club over 10 laps of the Isle
					of Man St John's Short Course of 15 miles 1,470 yards for road-legal 'touring' motorcycles.</p>

				 <p>In 1913 the Mountain circuit was used for the first time and 1913 also saw the first fatal accident
					at the TT - Frank R Bateman who died on the 6th June 1913.</p>

				 <p>A boycott of the Isle of Man TT races occurred from the early 1970s by many of the leading
					competitors, manufacturers and national motorcycle sporting federations due to the
					death of Gilberto Parlotti while competing in the TT races. He died in the second lap of the
					course while riding in the rain.</p>

				 <p>This year the event is been held from 26th May - 8th June 2018.</p>

				 <p>The TT mountain circuit is the greatest challenge any racing motorcyclist can take on, but it is not for the faint of heart. No one is forced to race here, they all come for one reason and one reason only, to pitch
					themselves against the greatest race circuit of them all, the TT Mountain Circuit, The Road Racing Capital of the World.</p>
